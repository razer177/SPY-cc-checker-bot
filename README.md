# üîê SPYCC CHECKER BOT (Educational)

> **Important:** This repository is an *educational* project meant to teach about payment-card data formats, basic validation (Luhn algorithm), and secure handling practices. **Do NOT use real, live card numbers, credentials, or other sensitive data** while testing. Always use test/dummy data provided by payment processors for development and learning purposes.

This bot runs on Telegram and demonstrates **safe, legal, and educational** features such as card-number format validation (Luhn check), explanations of card fields, and guidance on secure handling and compliance (PCI-DSS basics). It is **not** a tool to test or exploit real payment cards or to assist in fraud.

## üö´ What this project *isn't*
- Not for validating real or stolen credit/debit card numbers.
- Not for automating or facilitating transactions or fraud.
- Not for sharing or storing sensitive payment details.

## ‚úÖ Intended educational features
- Luhn algorithm validator for card number format (uses *test/dummy* numbers only).  
- Card type detection (Visa, Mastercard, Amex) based on BIN ranges ‚Äî educational only.  
- Explanations of common card fields (PAN, expiry, CVV) and why they are sensitive.  
- Tips for secure handling and PCI-DSS high-level guidance.  
- Optional demo messages and examples using **public test card numbers** (see below).

## üß™ Safe test card numbers (for development only)
Use only **test** numbers supplied by payment processors or the following examples (these will **not** work for real transactions):
- `4242 4242 4242 4242` ‚Äî Visa (Stripe test card)  
- `5555 5555 5555 4444` ‚Äî Mastercard (test)  
- `3782 822463 10005` ‚Äî American Express (test)

> These numbers are public test values for development. **Never** use real card numbers in logs, code, or examples.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech stack (example)
- Language: Python 3.10+ (or Node.js ‚Äî adapt as needed)  
- Telegram bot framework: `python-telegram-bot` (or `node-telegram-bot-api`)  
- Local dev: `.env` for tokens, no sensitive data checked into repo

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation (example ‚Äî Python)
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/telegram-security-edu-bot.git
   cd telegram-security-edu-bot
   ```

2. Create a Python virtual environment and install deps:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # Linux / macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows PowerShell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure environment variables (create a `.env` file):
   ```env
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11
   ```
   - Use a **bot token** from BotFather. **Do not** commit `.env` to version control.

4. Run the bot:
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

## üí¨ Example commands (bot)
- `/start` ‚Äî Welcome & explanation of project purpose  
- `/luhn <card-number>` ‚Äî Validate format using Luhn algorithm (educational only)  
- `/type <card-number>` ‚Äî Detect probable card type (Visa/Mastercard/Amex)  
- `/help` ‚Äî Security tips and safe development practices

## üîí Security & privacy guidance (short)
- Never log or store real PANs, CVVs, or full magnetic stripe data.  
- Use tokenization or payment-processor SDKs for real integrations.  
- Follow PCI-DSS and regional regulations when handling payment data.  
- Use environment variables and secrets managers for credentials.
